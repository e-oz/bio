    Hello.<br/>
    My name is Evgeniy.<br/>
    <br/>
    I'm a programmer.<br/>
    My main tools: Rust, TypeScript, Angular, Ionic, MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL.<br/>
    <div class="about">
      <br/>
      <em class="code-motto">Good code solves only existing issues, without extra universality, doesn't contain anti-patterns and covered by tests to be able to evolve.</em><br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Full-stack programmer.</strong><br/>
      <strong>Rust</strong> - since 2015,<br/>
      <strong>Angular</strong> - since 2011,<br/>
      <strong>PHP</strong> - since 2004.<br/>
      <br/>
      Technologies, apps and services I have experience with: Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP, Angular, Ionic, Karma, Protractor, Twitter Bootstrap, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, GAE, Cloudflare, Mandrill, PayPal, Stripe, Nexmo, AWS: EC2, S3,
      Cloudfront,
      Pipeline, CodeCommit, RDS; Jira, YouTrack, Git, Travis CI...<br/>
      <br/>
      I prefer to solve mathematically-challenging tasks (love to apply math to solve real world issues).<br/>
      I follow the best practices and my own years of experience to design apps architecture clean, scalable, easy for collaboration and code reuse.<br/><br/>
      Have a lot of experience with caching (also with mutexes, semaphores, preventing dog-pile and race condition effects, RAII control of resources).<br/><br/>
      My current achievement is 100% Rust REST API, serving multiple web and mobile apps (CRM, Task Manager, mobile apps, websites).<br/>
      Have experience of writing CRM, ERP and WMS for big e-commerce and small startups.<br/>
      <br/>
      In Angular I can write directives (components) of any level of complexity - including interactive maps (Angular+D3.js), nested trees, SVG elements and other fancy things.<br/>
      My components are always reusable. I write e2e and unit tests.<br/>Prefer to write frontend code in TypeScript.<br/><br/>
      I have experience with Ionic, I've created multiple mobile apps with this framework, including sofisticated WMS (Warehouse Management System), consisting of mobile apps (scanning, instructions, price stickers printing, items movement, delivery
      scheduling).<br/>
      <br/>
      My favorite books are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/">Clean code</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html">Patterns of
      Enterprise Application Architecture</a>.<br/>
      I like and respect SOLID principles, especially Separation of concerns.<br/>
      <br/>

      <div class="hidden pt1" id="story">
        My passion to programming started in school.<br/>
        In 2004 I've started making money by making websites.<br/>
        One of my first tools was FTP-editor - tool to upload, remove and edit files (mostly PHP-scripts). It was designed to be used from a mobile phone (in 2004 not every russian youngster had a computer, so "mobile first" for us was more than
        motto).<br/>
        But the most interesting thing about that editor - development of this tool had just 3 computer hours and rest of the code was written using this editor itself (yes, from a mobile phone).<br/>
        This tool helped dozens of people to create their first web sites (or WAP-sites).<br/>
        It was challenging but extremely rewarding.

      <div class="feedback">
        We recently completed an extended project (over 5 years and 9 months) with Evgeniy and are very pleased with his work and highly recommend him. The project expanded into many related projects and went well beyond its initial scope. As the need for different business tools took us in many different directions, Evgeniy was able to handle all of those pivots with great skill and determination.<br/>
        <br/>
        He worked on everything from our initial <b>PHP</b>/Phalcon website to mobile app development, building a custom CRM and task management system, internal business operation tools, landing pages, white-label members-only websites and much more.<br/>
        <br/>
        He is highly advanced in his abilities to solve business problems with web-based applications and to optimize those systems for high availability and performance.<br/>
        <br/>
        His approach is full-stack as he can handle everything from server setup, security, front-end development (latest version in <b>Angular</b>), backend development (latest version in <b>Rust</b>), <b>MySQL</b> optimization, OOP coding, unit tests and system documentation.<br/>
        <br/>
        Evgeniy is able to take project requirements, ask good questions, offer suggestions and deliver on whatever portion he is assigned. Working on our projects he also had to be very flexible and was able to change directions as needed.<br/>
        <br/>
        Based on our experience, we consider him one of the top programmers on Upwork and highly recommend him if you need a programmer that can help turn your ideas into working business solutions.<br/>
