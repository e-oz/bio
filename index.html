Hello.<br/>
My name is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_(given_name)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evgeniy</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a programmer.<br/>
<div class="about">
  <br/>
  <em class="code-motto">Good code solves only existing issues, without extra universality, doesn't contain anti-patterns and covered by tests to be able to evolve.</em><br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Rust</strong> - since 2015,<br/>
  <strong>Angular</strong> - since 2011,<br/>
  <strong>Ionic</strong> - since 2013,<br/>
  <strong>PHP</strong> - 2004 - 2016.<br/>
  <p>
  <strong>Technologies, apps and services I have experience with:</strong> Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP; Angular, Ionic, RxJS, NgRx, Nx, Karma, Protractor, Twitter Bootstrap; MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis; Cloudflare, Mandrill, PayPal, Stripe, Nexmo; GAE, AWS:
  EC2, S3, Cloudfront, Pipeline, CodeCommit, RDS; Jira, YouTrack, Git, Travis CI; SOA, REST, SOLID...
  </p>

  <p>
  I prefer to solve mathematically-challenging tasks (love to apply math to solve real-world issues).<br/>
  I follow best practices and my years of experience to design apps architecture clean, scalable, and easy for collaboration & code reuse.
  </p>

  <p>Have experience in writing CRM, ERP, and WMS for big e-commerce and small startups.</p>

  <p>In <strong>Angular</strong>, I can write directives (components) of any level of complexity - including interactive maps (Angular+D3.js), nested trees, SVG elements, and other fancy things.</p>

  <p>I can build a modern and solid foundation for your Angular project using Nx and NgRx, applying a collection of the industry’s leading solutions for the folders/components structure and organization.</p>

  <p>I can improve the performance of your app as much as possible, by using the OnPush strategy, tuning ZoneJS flags, using requestAnimationFrame, reducing reflows, and moving some modifications out of NgZone, and many other improvements.</p>

  <p>I can build best-practices-driven services and libraries, using RxJS, declarative event-driven programming, and Reduce patterns.</p>

  <p>I have experience with Ionic, I've created multiple mobile apps with this framework, including sophisticated WMS (Warehouse Management System), consisting of mobile apps (scanning, instructions, price stickers printing, items movement, delivery scheduling).</p>

  <p>I'm enjoying <strong>Rust</strong> programming since 2015.<br/>
  Most of my experience in Rust is related to webdev - REST API, DB connections, data analysis, and tasks background execution.
  Have a lot of experience with caching (also with mutexes, semaphores, preventing dog-pile and race condition effects, and RAII control of resources).
  </p>

  <p>One of my achievements is 100% Rust REST API, serving multiple Web and mobile apps (CRM, Task Manager, mobile apps, websites).</p>

  <p>As a contractor, I've been working with Vodafone (devices control system), NTT & Sony (Spartacus CRM custom payment system as a library)..</p>

  I like and respect SOLID principles.<br/>

  <ul>
    <li>I can:
      <ul class="uls">
        <li>Design software architecture (I prefer the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hexagonal architecture</a> pattern);
        </li>
        <li>Design a DB scheme and naming conventions;</li>
        <li>Create Web apps (frontend, backend), mobile apps, CLI tools, daemons, and libraries;</li>

    <li>When hired:
      <ul class="uls">
        <li>I will not answer "it's impossible" to feature requests;</li>
        <li>My main motivation is money - while an employer is paying, I'm doing the job;</li>
        <li>I can say my opinion, I can warn about consequences, but I will not confront - who pays the piper calls the tune;</li>
        <li>I don't work with rude or arrogant people (and money can't fix it);</li>
        <li>I will not disappear from a project accidentally (while alive);</li>
        <li>Work-life balance is a thing - I work 8 hours per day, not more. If a situation is critical - I'm online at any time, but it can't be happening every day.</li>

    Evgeniy is an extremely competent Rust developer. He implemented everything correctly with little management needed - the first drafts were production ready, communication spectacular, estimates precise, and his level of enthusiasm for the Rust language and ecosystem boundless. I'd be glad to work with him again any time.<br/>
    <br/>
  </div>
  <div class="feedback">
    <div class="feedback-signature">Ben Thole, Expansion LLC.:</div>
    We recently completed an extended project (over 5 years and 9 months) with Evgeniy and are very pleased with his work and highly recommend him. The project expanded into many related projects and went well beyond its initial scope. As the
    need for different business tools took us in many different directions, Evgeniy was able to handle all of those pivots with great skill and determination.<br/>
    <br/>
    He worked on everything from our initial
    <b>PHP</b>/Phalcon website to mobile app development, building a custom CRM and task management system, internal business operation tools, landing pages, white-label members-only websites and much
    more.<br/>
    <br/>
    He is highly advanced in his abilities to solve business problems with web-based applications and to optimize those systems for high availability and performance.<br/>
    <br/>
    His approach is full-stack as he can handle everything from server setup, security, front-end development (latest version in
    <b>Angular</b>), backend development (latest version in
    <b>Rust</b>),
    <b>MySQL</b> optimization, OOP coding, unit
    tests and system documentation.<br/>
    <br/>
    Evgeniy is able to take project requirements, ask good questions, offer suggestions and deliver on whatever portion he is assigned. Working on our projects he also had to be very flexible and was able to change directions as needed.<br/>
    <br/>
    Based on our experience, we consider him one of the top programmers on Upwork and highly recommend him if you need a programmer that can help turn your ideas into working business solutions.<br/>
